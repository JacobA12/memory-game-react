# Pokemon Memory Game

This project is a simple memory game built with React and Vite. The goal of the game is to click on each Pokemon card only once. If you click on a card more than once, the game resets, and your score is reset to 0.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite:** A build tool that provides a fast and optimized development experience.
